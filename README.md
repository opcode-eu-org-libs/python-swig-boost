Helpers for using SWIG Python library interfaces in Boost::Python based projects.

## Usage example

```
#include "swig2BoostPython.inl"

AAA* getObject();
void setValues(const AAA&, const BBB&);
BBB  getValue();

PREPARE_EXPOSE_PTR_VIA_SWIG(AAA, "AAA *");
PREPARE_EXPOSE_VIA_SWIG(BBB);

BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(MyPyAPI) {
	EXPOSE_PTR_VIA_SWIG(AAA);
	EXPOSE_VIA_SWIG(BBB);
	
	boost::python::def(
		"getObject",   &getObject,
		boost::python::return_value_policy<reference_existing_object_via_SWIG>()
	);
	boost::python::def("setValues", &setValues);
	boost::python::def("getValue",  &getValue);
}
```

Where `AAA` and `BBB` are types from library with SWIG Python interface.

* `AAA` can be abstract base class.
* `BBB` can't be abstract class but can be returned by copy.

Usage in Python:

```
import LibraryWithAAA   # import SWIG interface
import MyPyAPI          # import boost::python interface

a = MyPyAPI.getObject() # get SWIG object from boost::python system
```

### Build

1. generate swigpyrun.h file: `swig -python -external-runtime`
2. compile file with boost::python interface of your program
